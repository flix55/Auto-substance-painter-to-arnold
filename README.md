# Auto-substance-painter-to-arnold
This little script takes the 5 exported texture from susbtance painter (only PBR metalic for now) and automaticelly assign it to graph editor with the right setting for arnold. The project is still in early developement, I am planing upgrade to be more flexible 

just drag the python script into your scrtips folder  (\Users\You\Documents\maya\scripts) reaload maya and then open the script editor and write this in a python tab

- *main()*

(ctrl + a) and then go to (files) and save (script to shell)
you should now have the script as a little icon in your shels tabs
